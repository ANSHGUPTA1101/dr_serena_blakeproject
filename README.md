# Dr. Serena â€“ Therapy Website (Internship Project)

Hi! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a React + Vite project I built as part of my internship task for **GrowMyTherapy.com**. The website is designed for **Dr. Serena Blake**, a licensed therapist, and it includes a modern, mobile-responsive layout with a working contact form.

ðŸ”— **Live Site:** https://dr-serena-blakeproject-qoxga2r16-ansh-guptas-projects-9f2f8e24.vercel.app/

I used **React** along with **Vite** for fast development and modern tooling. The site includes multiple pages managed through **React Router**, and Iâ€™ve used **React Hooks** like `useState` and `useNavigate` for form state management and routing.

### Features:
- Fully **responsive** design for all screen sizes
- Professionally structured layout for a mental health professional
- **Contact form** with fields like:
  - Name, Email, Phone
  - Preferred contact time and method
  - Google reCAPTCHA ready
- Background video section for visual appeal
- Organized file structure using component-based design

### Tech Stack:
- React + Vite
- React Router DOM
- React Hooks
- CSS 
- Vercel (for deployment)

### How to Run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
